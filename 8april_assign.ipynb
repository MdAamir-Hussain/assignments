       "'To evaluate the performance of your SVM regression model for predicting house prices based on several characteristics, you can consider several regression metrics. The choice of the metric depends on the specific goals of your analysis and the characteristics of your dataset. Here are some commonly used regression metrics that you can consider:\\n\\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It gives you a sense of the magnitude of the errors in your predictions but does not indicate the direction of the errors.\\n\\nMean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more than MAE and provides a measure of the overall model performance.\\n\\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE and is a popular metric for regression tasks. It has the advantage of being in the same unit as the target variable, making it easy to interpret.\\n\\nR-squared (R²) Score: R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. R-squared is useful for understanding how well your model captures the variation in the data.\\n\\nWhen choosing the best metric for your SVM regression model, you should consider the specific context of your problem and the importance of different types of errors. For example, if you want to emphasize the magnitude of errors and their impact on pricing decisions, MAE or RMSE may be suitable. If you are more interested in the proportion of explained variance, R-squared could be a good choice.\\n\\nRegarding the dataset link you provided, it seems to be a Google Drive share link.
