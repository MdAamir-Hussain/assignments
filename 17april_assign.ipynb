Residuals can be interpreted as the \"errors\" made by the current model.\\n\\nTrain Weak Learner: Fit a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) to the residuals. The weak learner aims to capture the patterns or relationships in the data that the current ensemble model failed to learn.\\n\\nUpdate Ensemble Predictions: Multiply the predictions of the weak learner by a learning rate (or shrinkage factor) and add them to the current ensemble predictions. The learning rate controls the contribution of each weak learner to the ensemble and helps prevent overfitting.\\n\\nRepeat Steps 3-5: Repeat steps 3 to 5 iteratively, each time training a new weak learner on the residuals and updating the ensemble predictions. The number of iterations is typically a hyperparameter specified in advance.\\n\\nFinal Ensemble Prediction: The final prediction is obtained by summing the predictions of all weak learners in the ensemble.

    "'''Constructing the mathematical intuition of the Gradient Boosting algorithm involves understanding the underlying principles and mathematical concepts that drive its implementation. Here are the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Function: Define a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted values and the actual target values. The choice of the loss function depends on the specific problem, such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression or log loss (also known as binary cross-entropy) for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize Ensemble: Start by initializing the ensemble model with a constant value, typically the mean of the target variable for regression or the log-odds for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute Residuals: Calculate the residuals, which represent the differences between the actual target values and the predictions made by the current ensemble model. Residuals can be interpreted as the \"errors\" made by the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train Weak Learner: Fit a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) to the residuals. The weak learner aims to capture the patterns or relationships in the data that the current ensemble model failed to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update Ensemble Predictions: Multiply the predictions of the weak learner by a learning rate (or shrinkage factor) and add them to the current ensemble predictions. The learning rate controls the contribution of each weak learner to the ensemble and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat Steps 3-5: Repeat steps 3 to 5 iteratively, each time training a new weak learner on the residuals and updating the ensemble predictions. The number of iterations is typically a hyperparameter specified in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Ensemble Prediction: The final prediction is obtained by summing the predictions of all weak learners in the ensemble. Each weak learner's prediction is weighted by a factor proportional to its learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm lies in its ability to iteratively improve the ensemble model by focusing on the residuals or errors made by the previous models. Each weak learner is trained to capture and correct the mistakes of the ensemble, leading to a stronger model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the algorithm minimizes the loss function by updating the ensemble's predictions in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the residuals. This optimization process progressively reduces the errors and improves the model's ability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Gradient Boosting algorithm combines the predictions of multiple weak learners through a systematic and iterative process, leveraging their individual strengths to create a powerful ensemble model.'''"
