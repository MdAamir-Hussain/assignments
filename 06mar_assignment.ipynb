       "'Measures of central tendency and variability are two important types of descriptive statistics used to summarize and describe a dataset.\\n\\nMeasures of central tendency refer to values that summarize the central or typical value of a dataset. There are three common measures of central tendency:\\n\\nMean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers in the dataset, meaning that extreme values can have a large impact on the value of the mean. The mean is commonly used when the dataset has a symmetrical distribution.\\n\\nMedian: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data are arranged in order. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, making it a more appropriate measure of central tendency when the dataset contains extreme values or is skewed.\\n\\nMode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. The mode is most appropriate for categorical data, but can also be used for continuous data.\\n\\nMeasures of variability refer to the degree of spread or dispersion of a dataset. There are several common measures of variability:\\n\\nRange: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. The range provides a simple measure of variability but is sensitive to outliers.\\n\\nVariance: The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The variance is a more robust measure of variability than the range because it accounts for all values in the dataset, not just the minimum and maximum values.\\n\\nStandard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a common measure of variability and is often used to describe the spread of a dataset around the mean.\\n\\nIn summary, measures of central tendency and variability are used to describe the characteristics of a dataset.
