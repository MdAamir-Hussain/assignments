    "Hyperparameters: Regularized linear models have hyperparameters that need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance. Selecting the right hyperparameters can be challenging and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to outliers: Regularized linear models are sensitive to outliers in the data. Outliers can have a large impact on the coefficients of the model, which can result in poor performance.\n",

    "Non-linear relationships: Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the response variable. If the relationship is non-linear, the model may not perform well.\n",

    "In summary, regularized linear models are a useful tool for regression analysis, but they may not always be the best choice. The choice of model depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data. If interpretability is important, traditional linear regression may be a better choice. If the data is complex or the relationship between the predictors and the response variable is non-linear, other machine learning algorithms may be more appropriate.'''"
