       "\"Choosing the value of K in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is an important consideration that can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm.

You repeat this process for different K values and choose the one that yields the best performance (e.g., highest accuracy or lowest error rate).\\n\\nOdd vs. Even K: It is often recommended to use an odd value for K to avoid ties when classifying data points.
