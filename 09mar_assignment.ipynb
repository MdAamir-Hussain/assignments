    "Another example of the Uniform Distribution is the distribution of wait times at a stoplight. If the stoplight has a fixed duration of 60 seconds and the wait time is equally likely to occur at any point during the 60 seconds, then we can model this situation using a Uniform Distribution between 0 and 60. The PDF of the Uniform Distribution in this case would be:\n",
