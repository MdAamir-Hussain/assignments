We could create a binary variable indicating whether the wind direction is in a certain quadrant (e.g., North-East), and then calculate the covariance between temperature and the binary variable.\\n\\nHumidity and Weather Condition: Similarly to temperature, we could create a binary variable indicating whether the weather condition is sunny or not, and then calculate the covariance between humidity and the binary variable.\\n\\nHumidity and Wind Direction: Similarly to temperature, we could create a binary variable indicating whether the wind direction is in a certain quadrant, and then calculate the covariance between humidity and the binary variable.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the covariance between each pair of variables would depend on the specific values and the context of the problem.
