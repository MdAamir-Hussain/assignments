    "'''Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use built-in exceptions when possible: Python provides many built-in exceptions for common error conditions. Instead of creating a custom exception, use a built-in exception that accurately describes the error that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catch specific exceptions: When catching exceptions, catch only the exceptions that you expect and that you know how to handle. This allows other exceptions to propagate up the call stack and be handled elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep exception handlers short: Exception handlers should only contain the code necessary to handle the exception. Any other code should be placed outside the handler to keep the handler concise and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use finally blocks for cleanup: If you need to perform cleanup actions, such as closing a file or releasing a resource, use a finally block to ensure that the cleanup code is always executed, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use try-except-else blocks: Use try-except-else blocks to separate error handling code from normal code. The else block is executed only if no exception is raised, allowing you to keep normal code separate from error handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Log exceptions: When an exception occurs, log the error message and any relevant information, such as the input that caused the error. This makes it easier to diagnose and fix the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Don't catch all exceptions: Catching all exceptions with a broad except block can mask errors and make debugging more difficult. Instead, catch only the exceptions you expect and that you know how to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Avoid catching Exception: Catching the base Exception class can catch all exceptions, including those that you may not expect, such as SystemExit or KeyboardInterrupt. Catch only the exceptions that you expect and that you know how to handle.'''"
