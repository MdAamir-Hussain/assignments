It models each cluster as a Gaussian distribution with its own mean and covariance matrix.

It starts with a set of initial points and updates them based on the density gradient until convergence.

       "\"Implementing K-means clustering can come with a few challenges. Here are some common challenges and potential strategies to address them:\\n\\nDetermining the Number of Clusters (K): Choosing the appropriate number of clusters can be challenging. To address this, you can use techniques such as the elbow method, silhouette coefficient, or gap statistic to evaluate different values of K. Additionally, domain knowledge, expert opinions, or specific problem requirements can help guide the selection of the number of clusters.\\n\\nSensitivity to Initial Centroid Placement: K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can lead to different clustering results. One approach to mitigate this issue is to run the K-means algorithm multiple times with different random initializations and choose the clustering solution with the lowest distortion or highest silhouette coefficient.\\n\\nHandling Outliers: K-means clustering can be sensitive to outliers, as they can distort the positions of centroids and affect the clustering results. Consider preprocessing the data to identify and handle outliers appropriately. Techniques such as outlier detection or using robust versions of K-means, such as K-medoids (PAM algorithm), can help mitigate the influence of outliers.\\n\\nDealing with High-Dimensional Data: K-means clustering may face challenges when applied to high-dimensional data. The curse of dimensionality can lead to decreased clustering performance.

    "'''Implementing K-means clustering can come with a few challenges. Here are some common challenges and potential strategies to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the Number of Clusters (K): Choosing the appropriate number of clusters can be challenging. To address this, you can use techniques such as the elbow method, silhouette coefficient, or gap statistic to evaluate different values of K. Additionally, domain knowledge, expert opinions, or specific problem requirements can help guide the selection of the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Initial Centroid Placement: K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can lead to different clustering results. One approach to mitigate this issue is to run the K-means algorithm multiple times with different random initializations and choose the clustering solution with the lowest distortion or highest silhouette coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Outliers: K-means clustering can be sensitive to outliers, as they can distort the positions of centroids and affect the clustering results. Consider preprocessing the data to identify and handle outliers appropriately. Techniques such as outlier detection or using robust versions of K-means, such as K-medoids (PAM algorithm), can help mitigate the influence of outliers.\n",
