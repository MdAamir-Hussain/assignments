It categorizes points into three types: core points, border points, and noise points (outliers). Core points are data points that have a sufficient number of neighboring points within a specified distance (epsilon, ε). Border points are points that are not core points but lie within the epsilon-neighborhood of one or more core points.\\n\\nConnected Dense Regions: DBSCAN builds clusters by connecting dense regions in the data.

This process continues until no more core points or border points are found within the epsilon distance.\\n\\nVarying Density Clusters: DBSCAN can handle clusters with varying densities because it does not assume a fixed density threshold for all clusters. Instead, it adapts to the local density of data points. Dense regions will have many core points, while sparse regions will have fewer core points. Consequently, DBSCAN can capture clusters with different densities, from highly dense to sparsely populated regions.\\n\\nSeparating Different Density Regions: DBSCAN uses the notion of density reachability to separate different density regions in the dataset.

These metrics provide quantitative measures of how well the clustering algorithm performed in grouping the data points. Here are some commonly used evaluation metrics for DBSCAN clustering:\\n\\nSilhouette Score: The silhouette score measures the quality of clustering by evaluating the compactness and separation of clusters. It computes the average silhouette coefficient for all data points, where the coefficient measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better-defined and well-separated clusters.\\n\\nDavies-Bouldin Index (DBI): The DBI measures the clustering quality by evaluating the compactness and separation of clusters. It calculates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, taking into account the intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances. The lower the DBI value, the better the clustering quality, with values closer to 0 indicating more distinct and well-separated clusters.\\n\\nCalinski-Harabasz Index: The Calinski-Harabasz index, also known as the variance ratio criterion, measures the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. It quantifies the compactness and separation of clusters by evaluating the variance of the data points within clusters and the variance between clusters. Higher values of the Calinski-Harabasz index indicate better clustering results.\\n\\nDunn Index: The Dunn index assesses the clustering quality by evaluating the compactness and separation of clusters. It measures the minimum inter-cluster distance (between-cluster separation) divided by the maximum intra-cluster distance (cluster compactness). The higher the Dunn index, the better the clustering quality, with larger values indicating better-defined and well-separated clusters.\\n\\nRand Index: The Rand index measures the similarity between the clustering results and ground truth labels, if available. It calculates the percentage of data point pairs that are either in the same cluster or in different clusters in both the clustering result and the ground truth. The Rand index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better agreement between the clustering and true labels.\\n\\nJaccard Index: The Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard coefficient, measures the similarity between the clustering results and ground truth labels, if available. It calculates the ratio of the intersection of data point pairs in the same cluster to the union of data point pairs in the same cluster, considering both the clustering result and the ground truth.
