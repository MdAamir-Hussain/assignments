It works by iteratively training weak learners on modified versions of the training data and assigning weights to their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the AdaBoost algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: Each sample in the training data is assigned an initial weight, typically equal for all samples. These weights determine the importance of the samples during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Training: The AdaBoost algorithm performs a fixed number of iterations (or until a stopping criterion is met).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak Learner Training: In each iteration, a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) is trained on the training data. The weak learner is trained to minimize a weighted version of the exponential loss function, which assigns higher weights to misclassified samples from previous iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Error Calculation: The weighted error of the weak learner is computed by summing the weights of the misclassified samples. It measures the overall performance of the weak learner on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learner Weight Calculation: The weight of the weak learner is determined based on its weighted error. A lower weighted error corresponds to a higher weight for the weak learner. The weight of the learner is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "learner_weight = 0.5 * ln((1 - weighted_error) / weighted_error)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ln() function represents the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight Update: The weights of the samples are updated based on the weak learner's performance. The weights of the misclassified samples are increased, while the weights of the correctly classified samples are decreased. This emphasizes the importance of the misclassified samples in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Model Update: The weak learner is added to the ensemble model with its corresponding weight. The weight reflects the learner's performance. The ensemble model combines the predictions of all weak learners based on their weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat Steps 3-7: Steps 3 to 7 are repeated for the predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Prediction: The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all weak learners in the ensemble, weighted by their respective learner weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost algorithm focuses on difficult instances by adjusting their weights in each iteration, allowing subsequent weak learners to concentrate on them. By combining the predictions of multiple weak learners, AdaBoost creates a strong learner that achieves improved accuracy compared to individual weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights assigned to the weak learners and the samples are determined by their performance during training. AdaBoost gives more weight to the accurate weak learners and the misclassified samples, enabling the algorithm to iteratively improve the model's performance and handle complex classification tasks.'''"
