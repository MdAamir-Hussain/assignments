       "\"Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that aims to reduce overfitting in decision trees by introducing randomness in the training process.

This means that each bootstrap sample may contain duplicate observations and may exclude some original observations. By introducing random sampling, bagging generates diverse subsets of the training data, allowing each decision tree to be trained on a slightly different set of observations.\\n\\nDecorrelated Models: The diversity introduced by random sampling in bagging leads to the creation of decorrelated decision trees. When training individual decision trees, each tree focuses on different subsets of the data and learns different aspects of the relationships between features and the target variable.

Since each tree has been trained on a different subset of the data and has its own biases and errors, averaging their predictions helps to smooth out the individual inconsistencies and errors. By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, the ensemble model becomes more robust and generalizable.\\n\\nReduced Variance: Overfitting often arises from high variance in the model, where small changes in the training data can lead to significant fluctuations in the predictions.
