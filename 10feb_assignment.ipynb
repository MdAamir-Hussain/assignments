    "'w' (Write Only): The file is opened in write-only mode. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file with the specified name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): The file is opened in append mode. If the file already exists, new data will be appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file with the specified name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): The file is opened in exclusive creation mode. If the file already exists, an error will be raised. If the file does not exist, a new file with the specified name will be created.\n",

    "'b' (Binary Mode): The file is opened in binary mode. This mode is used when reading or writing binary files, such as images or audio files.\n",

If you open a file in read mode, you might not be able to access the file again until you close it.\n",
